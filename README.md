## 🔧 Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Create WLAN Profiles  
Begin by defining **WLAN profiles** that include:
- 📶 **SSID names** to identify each wireless network  
- 🧩 **VLAN mappings** to segment network traffic  
- 🔐 **Security settings** such as WPA2-PSK or 802.1X authentication

---

### 2. Deploy Lightweight Access Points (LAPs)  
Integrate **lightweight access points** into the network:
- Connect each LAP to the infrastructure  
- Ensure automatic discovery and registration with the WLC

### 3. Apply Wireless Security  
Secure your wireless environment by configuring:
- **WPA2-PSK** for pre-shared key encryption  
- Or **802.1X** for enterprise-level authentication  

---

### 4. Manage & Monitor via WLC GUI  
Use the WLC’s intuitive **graphical user interface** to:
- Monitor connected wireless clients and access points  
- Adjust bandwidth, coverage, and security settings  
- Maintain high performance and network integrity
